CANNIBALISM
</h>
Broken questions bubble inside me,
Like horrid, rotten seeds,
Fermenting within the depths of my being, 
Ruminating and oxidizing.

Until my very structure rusts to the point of immobility,
I grind against the crumpling orange remnants,
In search of the regretless days and nights that I remember. 

Repressed and pressed again-- the steady metronome of churning.
If you reach in far enough, you can feel my organs.
If you had paused, you’d have felt my pulse.
After everything, it’s clear that digestion slows when you’re repulsed. 

Cannibalism-- does it count if I consume myself?
Does it count if even my flesh doesn’t feel my own?
Did it count when you chewed me up and spit me out?
Did it count?

Ants and intoxicants, crawling and colonizing.
How electrifying to be a part of something more.
