CHRONIC PAIN AND ANXIETY
</h>
There’s a tumultuous landscape, undulating convex and concave structures.
I’m vexed, I’m going to cave in-- A construction of the mind.
I’m in it for the long con-- No, I’m just scraping by,
I’m confined (to land). And as usual, my tummy hurts.
If only I knew what was underlying those undulating convex and concave structures.
Perhaps a mere construction of the mind...
I’m conning myself, I’m tumbling down.
I’m cursed by a hex.
I want to relate to my past, understand my present.
I’m confused by the strict strokes of memory,
Like tumors and cavities.
Fuck this tumultuous landscape of undulating convex and concave structures. 
If only I understood.
