DEEP BREATHS
</h>
I’m overwhelmed by the physical. 
I think I can feel myself breathing, inhaling, but no exhale. 
My body is a billowing balloon, eclipsing the sun and everything else. 
Fear brings pain and pain brings fear. 
If I don’t release, I might pop and explode, 
But isn’t that the thought of yet another swift inhale?
