TIME TO FILL MY EMPTY BASKET
</h>
<poem>
They told us to shame nudity,
So we would buy their clothes.
They taught us about relationships,
So he would buy a rose.

They commissioned us to kill,
And applauded it as patriotism.
They praise us for our professions,
Solely because it benefits them.

They spoonfed us our values,
And made us think they were our own.
They exploited our insecurities, 
And took their paycheck home.

We sold ourselves to buy an identity.
