  INCIDENT GUIDANCE
  </h>
<p>Stay away, pay no mind,
<br>drown yourself in yellow skies,
<br>swallow the ocean--
<br>your thirst will prove you blind.
</p>
<p>Fate, they say, you can't choose.
<br>Endless like tides,
<br>til you lynch the moon.
</p>
<p>But how does one complain, 
<br>when everything comes in waves?
</p>
