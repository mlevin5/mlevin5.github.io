(IN)VOLUNTARY EMOTIONAL RESPONSE
</h>
Deep inside our core
Lies widespread infection.
Solitary confinement.
We’re sick with apprehension.

Intimacy with the string
That tugs from throat to heart.
Self-deprecation. 
We tear ourselves apart.

Every beautiful thing
Is burned down to ashes.
Cynical imposition.
We wear the devil’s glasses.
