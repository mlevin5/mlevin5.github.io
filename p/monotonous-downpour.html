MONOTONOUS DOWNPOUR
</h>
What’s it matter if the universe is infinite?
We are all confined to a space.
In cornered walls and rounded skulls,
We live through one sole face.

Thriving off fleeting delusions, 
Like hope and inspiration,
I pray that we find sanctity
Through ignorant liberation.

Grids! Walls! Boxes!
In all of this order we’ve been trapped...

Trading life for purpose,
Brainwashed into progress,
Waiting on the structure,
With systematic service.

And insurance-- that paradoxical necessity
And bain of our existence,
Like the hourglass of certainty
Filled with sand from tireless oceans.
