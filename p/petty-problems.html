PETTY PROBLEMS & PITY PARTIES
</h>
Thoughts in different voices,
Living through the fear.
The only thing with certainty
Is that entropy perseveres. 

Fighting between yourself
And who you’re told to be,
The differences from right and wrong,
Illusory, unseen.

But I’ve seen so many faces,
Yet not one of them is my own.
Ambiguity, frustration,
The desire to be alone.

Entwined with guilt and sorrow,
The roots of our demise,
To be free in one’s own skin,
Allowing others to see through your eyes.

“Universal morality”
And spoon-fed predisposition
No shit that people are dying
To voice their own opinion

Relative importance
Secondary “needs”
Planets in rotation
Everybody bleeds...
