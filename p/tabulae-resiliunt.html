TABULAE RESILIUNT
</h>
They speak through shrouded mirrors,
And face fluorescent eyes,
In thinking of roads fractured,
They see cracks in summer skies.

Their Dyonisian consumption
With Apollonian ideals
Invites a self-destruction, 
Which only stasis heals.

Their past acts as their poison,
Contrived by canon’s chemist.
They’re burning with the reason,
But frozen in the present.
