<h>
THAN BEFORE
</h>
And I still walk along a road
Where forgotten memories overflow
And the grass turns green once a year
After death consumes the forest air
But I still walk along a road
No longer teaming with what I was told
A confidence no longer present
Like a slouch in a proud soul
Like the grass has quit its growth
You don’t believe in yourself anymore
And you’ll always be lesser
Than before.
