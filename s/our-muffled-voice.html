  OUR MUFFLED VOICE, OUR VIOLENT RAGE
</h>
<p>“Hey,” Emily said, muffled by the cigarette between her lips, nudging her elbow into Dan-o’s side, “you got a light?” </p>
<p>Pausing his conversation, he turned his head towards her and gave her a nod, the chain strung from his ear to his nose clinking. He flicked his lighter, holding the flame to her Camel ninety-nine. </p>
<p>Everyone knows that shows run on punk-time. If the band says they’re going on at six, no one expects music until eight, but with the time being around nine now, this show was taking particularly long to start. So, in the meantime, people congregated outside smoking cigs and downstairs pounding beers at the bar. </p> 
<p>Dan-o continued, “So yeah, Discharge is playing with Eyehategod in a week or something, but apparently the singer can’t make it, so the singer from Lamb of God is taking his place instead, like what the fuck? Who fucking likes Lamb of God?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never even heard of Lamb of God. I’d still go though, I want to see Discharge before they’re dead.” Emily said, chuckling, “but isn’t that show sold out though?” </p>
<p>“Well I’ve got a ticket, you got thirty bucks?”</p>
<p>“Oh man, yeah I got thirty bucks let’s fucking go!”</p>
<p>“It’s a date.”</p>
<p>Dan-o was the kind of guy that looked hard, clad in tattoos and a studded leather vest with a huge anarchy symbol painted on the back and a patch below it that read “I FUCK TO CUM, NOT TO CONCIEVE,” but he was really more of a huge puppy dog. Emily was worried that he might have been flirting with her with that last comment, but she could deal with ignoring that if it meant getting a ticket to the show. </p>
<p>Discharge is super classic, they’re the band that started the whole d-beat genre in the 80s, and we all know how much the Boston punks love d-beat. There’s got to be hundreds of crust punk bands named Dis-this and Dis-that because of Discharge, to the point where its a running joke. </p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, did you catch where Justine said she went?” Emily asked Dan-o.</p>
<p>“Nah, I don’t…” Dan-o started, and then fixed his gaze past Emily, “Oh, speak of the devil.”</p>
<p>Emily turned around to see her roommate, Justine, climbing up the stairs from the basement of the venue and walking towards her and Dan-o. Justine was like a sister to Emily, they had been living together in Senior House, their college dorm, for over two years now. She had long blonde hair and always spoke her mind, but wasn’t the kind of girl you would expect to see at a punk show. However, tonight, Emily had finally been able to convince Justine to come out with her after she found out that she had failed one of her tests and Emily assured her that going to a show was the absolute best way to relieve stress.</p>
<p>“Jesus, that bathroom down there was so gross,” Justine gagged. Emily and Dan-o looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>“Hey man, what’re you gunna do?” Dan-o said through the exhale of his cigarette. </p>
<p>Suddenly, Emily felt vigorous tapping on her shoulders and whirled around to find Robespierre and Annabelle behind her with huge grins across their faces.</p>
<p>“Aye buddy!” Robespierre shouted out.</p>
<p>“Yoooo! Shit, I haven’t seen you guys in so long!”  Emily exclaimed. She put her arms around both of them and pulled them into one large hug.  </p>
<p>Robespierre was a twenty-something year-old from Colombia that speaks somewhat-broken English and has two eyebrow rings on the right side of his face. At shows, he always spikes his black and bleach blonde hair into long liberty spikes all around his head and wears the band shirts he screen prints himself, studded belts, and of course, a spikey leather jacket with patches of all the good local Boston bands and some of his friends’ bands in Colombia. He was the kind of guy that got invited to a party Saturday night, passed out drunk super late, and woke up Sunday morning downing a beer and snorting a couple lines of coke as if there was no reason to be exhausted at all from the night before. There had been a long-running joke where Rob hooked up with this random girl Rebecca before he had started dating Annabelle and after being asked about it, he responded “Yeah buddy, I ate ass for two hours!” When Rebecca was questioned on the validity of Rob’s claims, they proved slightly hyperbolic, but that didn’t stop everyone from jokingly yelling, “Ay buddy, two whole hours!!!” whenever they saw Rob. He’s also an incredible tattoo artist, he’s done almost all of his tattoos himself, and they aren’t just shitty stick-n-pokes, they’re the real deal. </p>
<p>Annabelle, also called Pixie by a lot of people in the scene, is a tiny 18 year-old girl always decked out in a spikey black denim jacket, bondage belts and chokers, the whole nine yards. It seemed like every time she went to a show, her short hair was always a different color; blue, purple, green, black, you name it. She was the type of girl that smoked a ton of weed and always had snacks on her. She was also really into photography, and took the bands pictures at all the shows. The one punk house on Prospect St. where Rob used to live got its nickname Glitter House when she had been there tripping mad balls on acid and running around naked with glitter all over her tits. She actually lived all the way out by Lexington with her over-bearing psycho-hippie mom who believed that everyone has an alternative name from a past life; apparently Emily’s was Betsy. Recently, Rob and Annabelle got married so he would have citizenship and she could move out of her wack-job-of-a-mom’s house.</p>
<p>“Hey guys, this is my friend Justine,” I introduced, “Justine, this is Rob and Annabelle.” </p>
<p>“Wassup Justine!” Rob exclaimed as he reached out and rustled up her hair. </p>
<p>“Oh, hey, I’ve heard a lot of stories about you guys from Emily,” Justine giggled.</p>
<p>“Oh yes I am sure,” Rob laughed.</p>
<p>“Have the bands started yet?” Annabelle asked Emily, looking up with her wide eyes, freckled face, and double nose piercings.</p>
<p>“Nah man, but I think they’re settin’ up,” she replied.</p>
<p>Tonight was Ellie’s band Cinderblock, Gabe’s band Symptom, and the touring band Pollen from Philly. Everyone in the scene comes out when Cinderblock plays because they’re such a breathe of fresh 80s UK-style street punk as opposed to the slew of shitty Boston crust punk bands, and the shows at the Elk’s Lodge are always great. But, most of the venues in Boston are absolutely repulsive. They’re pricey, super corporate, and you go knowing that your favorite band sold out. Even some of the DIY venues are awful, like the Democracy Center. It’s full of fashion punks that stand arms-crossed in the back of the room lightly banging their head, but not too hard of course, or god forbid they’ll fuck up their mohawk. These guys are the type that are just too “woke” to hear any other opinion besides their own, don’t mosh “because it’s sexist,” and stir up all kinds of petty drama, like they all want to climb the ridiculous punk social ladder they’ve created for themselves.  </p>
<p>Emily was catching up with Rob and Annabelle, when, in an instant, the deep thudding sound of a bass guitar could be heard reverberating through the ground as the band kicked up in the basement.  Raising her eyebrows and motioning towards the door, Emily stomped out her cigarette and hop-skipped down the stairs, tagging Rob, Annabelle, and Justine to follow along. They shuffled past the bar and made their way through the gathering of familiar faces and towards the front of the pit. </p>
<p>“Wait, we’re going to the front?” Justine quietly asked Emily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, dude it’s all about moshing, I hate going to shows where no one moshes! That’s like the whole fun.” Emily explained, but Justine looked unconvinced. </p>
<p>“I think I’ll just watch first,” she said, “I dunno if I wanna do that” </p>
<p>“C’mon, don’t be a puuussy, it’s not as crazy as it looks, I promise. The first time I went in the pit I was mad I hadn’t done it sooner, forreal it’s fun as fuck. I’m like, five feet tall, if I can do it, you can do it.”</p>
<p>“Ooookay,” Justine sighed as she watched Ellie and the rest of Cinderblock finish sound checking and get ready for the set.</p>
<p>The feedback from the guitar screeched, filling the air with eerie anticipation. The drums and bass began to tumble into a jarringly deep and excitedly fast pace, inciting a thick tension of premonitions to adrenaline and violence. Bursting at the knuckles, Ellie nearly strangled the microphone when he quickly thrust forward and screamed in anguish, face red and a singular vein popping out on his forehead. The guitar cut in, ripping into the fast-beating hearts of the crowd, and the ever-viscous chaos released, exploding out and oozing in all directions. A soup of flying fists and rampant bodies boiled and erupted as Ellie belted out the lyrics.</p>
<p>“…Without an enemy but thine self, subculture packed and shelved, forced underground by social choice, where no one hears our muffled voice, no one sees our violent rage, no one cares, not even me...”</p>
<p>People from the crowd rushed up and shouted along into the microphone, thrusting their fists into the air, while everyone in the pit moshed some old fashioned side-to-side, charging into one side of the crowd to bounce off into the other. Justine tried following Emily’s example, but got pushed out of the pit. She nodded her head to the music towards the back, occasionally pushing off people that flew her way.</p>
<p>This one guy with huge stretched lobes, Tan, dove off one of the benches into the crowd, causing a ripple of people upholding his body. All Emily knew about Tan was the first time she met him at Glitter House, he chugged a whole bottle of cheap vodka and puked a shit-ton immediately after. </p>
<p>This other guy, Owen, that Emily had met back at the Peter and the Test Tube Babies show at the Middle East, a venue in Central Square, started swinging on the pipes on the ceiling, kicking his feet into the air. Some skinhead rushed up to him and seemed to be telling him to cut it out, since he got down from the pipes right after. Meanwhile, everyone else continued raging on. </p>
<p>There was this meth-head guy with a mullet that always hung out at the front of the pit at shows, biting the top of his shirt with manic eyes and thrashing about. Emily always made sure to avoid him in the pit because he was a crazy junkie and was known to crowd-kill. Back at the Aspects of War show at some warehouse space in Roxbury, things started getting very violent in the pit, as it usually does with Aspects of War, whose music can best be described as a wall of noise; it’s absolutely brutal. Emily’s elbows had gotten scraped up and bloody from the violence of it all. But, this guy started taking it too far. He was grabbing random people by the ears in the pit and smashing his dense head into their faces. After the show, Mateo, a close friend of Emily’s and a victim of this guy’s insanity, was standing by, getting ready to confront him. He then very suddenly turned around in one stomp and bellowed “What the fuck are you looking at?!” and charged at Mateo, head-butting him in the nose repeatedly before he even had time to react. Fueled by the confidence and recklessness of perhaps one too many beers, Emily tried to tackle meth-head mullet-man off of Mateo, but being a small girl, ended up just dangling on top of him attempting to choke him. He threw her off and prepared to place a large fist straight in Emily’s face, but before he could, people in the crowd yanked him away, and someone shouted for Mateo and Emily to get out of there. Mateo was still on the ground with blood dripping down his swollen face and all over his ripped t-shirt. Emily picked him up and they scrammed real fast. It’s a wonder that everyone didn’t decide to bar him from shows and kick him out of the scene for that, but here in Boston the benefit of doubt almost always seemed to lie with whoever was the most ‘involved’ and ‘connected’ in the scene.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Emily spied Annabelle watching the show across the pit, charged at her and swung her into the mess. Annabelle looked back laughing, scrunching up her nose and charged right back at Emily. They continued to throw elbows, bouncing off the crowd and each other every which way. </p>
<p>Then, the song ended and the crowd settled down and clapped, the occasional hearty “YEAAAH” coming from different corners of the room. The band immediately started into the next song, and the crowd erupted once again. Emily, out of breath from all the exertion and excitement, weaved through the crowd to find Justine, who was towards the back by the merch table. </p>
<p>“Hey, let’s go to the bar!” Emily shouted to Justine over the noise. Justine nodded and they exited the stage room and entered the room with the little rinky-dink bar and each ordered a beer. </p>
<p>“Why’d you disappear?” Emily asked, sipping her Narragansett.</p>
<p>“I just feel like watching, I don’t wanna mosh,” Justine said, “It’s just too spooky for me! Like, everyone has a buncha spikes and chains all over them, I’m not tryna tussle with those guys if you feel me.”</p>
<p>“Hey man, I feel like you’re just not giving it a chance. I’m wearing the same shit, it’s just clothes, it doesn’t mean I’m going to fuck you up. It’s all just fun.”</p>
<p>“I mean, that’s part of it too though, I just feel kind of out of place. And I don’t get it either, isn’t punk supposed to be about non-conformity or something? Then why do you all dress the same? It’s like a uniform, man,” Justine said, pointing at Emily’s army jacket covered in buttons and patches.</p>
<p>“Dude, I dunno, what we wear isn’t really important, it’s just one way of walking around and telling people, ‘hey, I don’t agree with the shit that’s happening in society,’ ya know? Plus, it’s just fun to wear shit that makes you feel like…” Emily paused, drinking a gulp of her beer, “that makes you feel like you, I guess.”</p>
<p>“But do you think that actually makes a difference? Like, I imagine your typical person doesn’t see a punk and think ‘oh man, that person is angry at the man, maybe I should be angry at the man, too,’ like I don’t think so, they probably just think they’re a dumb teenager or a criminal or a druggie or something.”</p>
<p>Emily rolled her eyes, “I mean, it’s more than just being ‘angry at the man,’ dude, and people in the scene do a lot of political activism and shit to change things, that’s like the whole point of punk. At least we’re trying, what the fuck is anyone else doing? What message do the clothes you wear send? ‘I shop at multinational corporations that fuck people over’? ‘I want to blend in with the herd’?” </p>
<p>“Hey dude, chill. I just feel like if you’re trying to make a difference or whatever, you should probably care about if what you’re doing actually works or not, that’s all I’m saying.” </p>
<p>Emily furrowed her brow; Justine probably just didn’t understand. But, she did bring up a fair point, one that had come across Emily’s mind from time to time— how does a community of people without much power push their political agenda and make a difference in society? And did the punk scene actually do that? Or was it all just a big jerkoff? And if it was, then what really was the point? Emily wanted to believe that punk wasn’t just a bunch of leftist alcoholics having a pissing contest of who can have the sickest band, or the spikiest jacket, or the most popular zine, but she had no real defense against Justine’s doubt in the efficacy of their methods. In the end, had the efforts of the punk scene really ever made a difference?</p>
<p>“Whatever dude, let’s just go back to the show and have a good time, alright?” Emily said to Justine, knowing she was in an irritable mood because of her test and wanting to put the issue to rest. The two of them wove back through the crowd to the right of the pit where the benches were, and stood on top of one, watching the antics from above.</p>
<p>A bench down was Owen, who started swinging on the pipe on the ceiling again. Apparently he’s straightedge, but that guy always seems like he’s on something, and a lot of it. The same skinhead pushed through the crowd to him, even angrier this time, and shouted something at Owen, who just wasn’t having it. He swung back and kicked the skinhead in the chest, causing him to fall backwards into the crowd and onto the floor. </p>
<p>When someone falls in the pit, the people nearby will always try to help you up as fast as they can so that you don’t get trampled. Even in all the violence, people still watched out for each other. But this guy had not fallen from clumsy moshing. He sprung up from the ground fist first, straight into the side of Owen’s face, which proceeded to devolve into a full-on fistfight. Owen was an idiot for picking a fight with this guy; he was huge, and skinheads seemed to have this propensity to fight for no better reason than the thrill, whereas Owen was just a lanky teenager who wore the same Boston Bruins cap everyday. As everyone in the pit stopped and surrounded the two, trying to pull them apart, Emily tagged Justine along and made a dash for the back of the room to watch from afar, learning from the last fight at the Aspects of War show and not wanting to catch any stray punches. </p>
<p>“Oh my god, they’re crazy,” Justine sighed with a judgmental tone.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this happens sometimes, it’s annoying,” Emily admitted. </p>
<p>The fight turned into in a huge clusterfuck of people that sloppily traveled across the room and knocked over a stack of speakers and some equipment. The band’s sound cut out at that point and everyone cleared out of the pit area. Emily and Justine followed suit and went up the stairs out of the basement and outside next to the building looking for Rob and Annabelle. </p>
<p>“Hey, I know you. Emily, right?” someone called from behind Emily. She turned around to see a kid with a mohawk in the usual garb that she didn’t immediately recognize.</p>
<p>“Oh man, uh, I think so? Are you PJ?” </p>
<p>“Nah, I’m Chris, I think I was bald last time you saw me though.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah! Sorry I have terrible memory, you came and hanged out at Senior House that one time”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I think so, that one house yeah.”</p>
<p>“Well what’s up? That fight was fucking stupid, it cut the set way too short”</p>
<p>“Yeah that shit was dumb, do you know what happened?”</p>
<p>“Yeah it looked like Owen just really wanted to swing on the pipes but some dude told him not to, so the natural response was to start throwing punches, right.”</p>
<p>“What a dumb ass reason, that kid’s crazy.” </p>
<p>“You can say that again,” Justine added in, rolling her eyes and scoffing.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t think I’ve met you, you’re…?” Chris began to ask.</p>
<p>“I’m Justine, I live in Senior House with Emily.”</p>
<p>“Ah cool.” Chris said, nodding his head and taking a drag of his cigarette.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just the Satan-cunt-whore herself that Emily had been hoping wouldn’t be at the show, appeared out of thin air, saying hi to Chris and giving Emily a meek sup-nod. A wave of nausea moved throughout Emily’s body at the mere site of her. Jessie had black hair with straight bangs and looked quite a lot like Emily in general, which only added insult to injury. In fact, at the PMS84 show a couple weeks ago at the Middle East, some kid came up to Emily while she was having a smoke outside between sets and flicked her stretched ear lobe saying, “I didn’t know you had these?” Confused, she turned to find someone she had never met and responded, “Uhh, do I know you?” The guy paused, studying Emily’s face before saying “Oh shit! You look just like Jessica!” Emily’s blood proceeded to boil. </p>
<p>Emily’s evil doppelgänger was the kind of person that constantly sought attention and drama, and would conjure up any lie to get what she wanted. She’s also a high school dropout who’s been in the scene for a while, yet still gets away with lying to everyone that she’s years older than her actual age, sixteen.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable in Emily’s presence, Jessie disappeared as fast as she arrived. Chris, Emily, and Justine continued talking about this and that when Rob and Annabelle stomped up the stairs with a disgruntled look on their face. </p>
<p>“Ayo Rob, Annabelle,” Emily called, grabbing their attention.</p>
<p>“Hey man, the show’s done.” Rob said sadly.</p>
<p>“What? Cinderblock was only on for like one song, there’s like two more bands left?” Emily said in a pissed off voice.</p>
<p>“Yeah, are you serious? Wow.” Justine muttered, casting Emily a disgruntled look.</p>
<p>“The guy fucked the speakers, they can’t play shit” Rob said.</p>
<p>“Yeah I think they broke the sound board or something, I don’t really know.” Annabelle added.</p>
<p>“Is everyone just peacin’ out? This fucking sucks.”</p>
<p>“Yeah looks like it.” Annabelle replied</p>
<p>“Well do you guys wanna come back to my dorm and hangout or something?”</p>
<p>“Dude, I wish, we have to catch a plane at FIVE AM tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>“Oh man, where are you guys going?”</p>
<p>“Colombia!” said Rob with a huge grin on his face.</p>
<p>“Oh sick, how long are you guys going for?”</p>
<p>“Don’t know! We just bought a one-way ticket, were gunna live with Rob’s family in their house on the mountains, it’s gunna be so great!” Annabelle said with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Holy shit so you guys are leaving?” Emily exclaimed. They both nodded.</p>
<p>“Damn, I’m gunna miss you guys like hell.”</p>
<p>“Come visit us! Whenever you want!” Rob said, and added, “And you too Justine, it was very cool to meet you!”</p>
<p>“I will totally take you guys up on that, no lie, I’ll come visit,” Emily said.</p>
<p>“It was nice meeting you guys, too. Stay safe!” Justine replied.</p>
<p>Rob and Annabelle said they should probably head out and get some sleep for their flight. Emily hugged them goodbye and hoped that the next time she was hugging them was in Colombia. </p>
<p>“Are they really just up and leaving to Colombia? Just like that?” Justine turned to Emily and asked her once Rob and Annabelle were out of earshot. </p>
<p>“Yeah dude, you can never really guess what some of these guys will do or where they’ll go, I’ve learned not to be surprised,” Emily laughed, motioning towards all the other punks standing around outside.</p>
<p>“Seems kind of reckless if you ask me. In fact, this whole night has been the epitome of recklessness. What do you get out of all of it? I just don’t get it,” Justine prodded. </p>
<p>“I mean, I enjoy the recklessness! That’s the best part, it’s such a nice break from predictable and orderly and boring everyday life.”</p>
<p>“Ok, so you enjoy fights breaking out?”</p>
<p>“Well no, not that kind of recklessness. More like the kind that drove Rob and Annabelle to just pick up and go to Colombia; wouldn’t you want to just do that? Just go?” Emily dramatically whisked her arm out into the air and continued, “I mean, I guess that’s another thing about punk, it’s everywhere you go. You’ve got friends all over the world; anywhere you go, you have this community that will almost always welcome you no matter what. Yeah, it’s clearly got some ideological flaws, but like, have you ever seen people so free to be their reckless, idiot selves?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess I see what you’re saying,” Justine admitted, “but tonight was pretty lame, we spent so much more time waiting than being at the actual show.”</p>
<p>“Hey, maybe next time?” Emily asked Justine, hoping that despite the events of tonight, Justine got to see what it was that Emily loved about punk, and hoping that she could continue to share that with her.</p>
<p>“You know what? I’m down. I think after tonight I deserve to go to a real show,” Justine smirked. The two girls laughed and decided to start walking home, returning back to reality, and saving that other dimension of debauchery for another day.</p>
